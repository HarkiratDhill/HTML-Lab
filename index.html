    <p>I am a student at the Southern Alberta Insitute of Technology (SAIT)
        and in the Graphic Design course for the School of Advanced Digital Technology.
    </p>
    <p>I am so far half way through the semester, and have learned quite a few new skills
        and have learned how to use certain tools.
