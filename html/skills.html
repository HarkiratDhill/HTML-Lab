    <h2>Web Communication Skills/Tools</h2>
    <section id="Web Comms">
        <p>
            When I was starting out using html in <strong>Web Communications</strong> I was initally a bit confused 
            as to what I was supposed to do, but after reviewing the async learning and using Visual Studio Code more, 
            I was able to understand how to add unordered and order lists. I have also learned how to use the shortcuts on 
            Visual Studio Code when I am making a paragraph or adding in a link or image to my website. Also I have learned a 
            great deal when it comes to using Github and Github desktop from using the Markdown synthax to easily make titles 
            and have links to my email and how to commit and publish my work from Github desktop to the Github website, in order
            for my work to be saved fully.

    <h2>Digtal Media Foundations Skills/Tools</h2>
    <section id="Digital Media">
        <p>
            My most important skill that I learned from <strong>Digital Media Foundations</strong> was how to operate a 
            camera. From managing the aperture of the camera to focus on the right part of an image. I also learned that
            overexposer of the aperture will cause the shot the camera takes to be too bright for visablity. Another form this 
            can take is having to low of an exposure causing the shot a camera takes to be darker than intended. I also learned 
            how to make scripts properly with the resources given to me in <strong>Digital Media Foundations</strong> with 
            studio binder and how to properly format storyboards and make shotlists.

    <h2>Old Skills</h2>
    <p>
        I have had a few skills from high school at Nelson Mandela from my animation and design class.
    </p>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>making layers in Adobe Illustrator</li>
            <li>making logos</li>
            <li>creatiing interesting text</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <h2>Visual Media Design Skills/Tools</h2>
    <section id="Visual Design">
        <p>
            During my time in <strong>Visual Media Design</strong> I had to bring back some old skills I use to have
            from my high school days when it came to using Adobe Illustrator. These skills were using the layer tool in 
            Illustrator in order to make sure that my other graphics and works in Illustrator were not affected when I was 
            removing something from another layer or adding it in, as it would be in it's own specific layer. Another skill 
            that I have used, which is making interesting logos by expanding parts of the base logo to make it more 
            interesting or pop out more. I would sometimes even try to add more shapes to my logos or use the pen tool to 
            have the logo be shaped in a more organic manner instead of a simple geometric manner. Another skill I use is 
            making interesting text by turning the letters of a word into a path to shape them into a more intense look, 
            and I would also use the built in tools of Illustrator to position the text in odd ways.
