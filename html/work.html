    <h1>Projects Done</h1>
    <a href="./index.html">Homepage</a>
    <p>I have done various types of projects in my time at SAIT, from knowing how to make a
        professional email, to making a script and my personal graphic.

    <h2>Professional Email</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            One of my first projects that I had done was a professional email to one of my 
            instrcutors in order to understand how best to articulate any questions I may have with 
            my assignments or asking other members at SAIT for information on how to acess certain tools
            at SAIt. The assignment also showed me the various ways I can send a email to someone and 
            properly address them.

    <h2>Script Making</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            One of my major assignments I had to do was one where I had to make a script that had me use 
            Studio binder for making the proper format of the script. In Studio binder I had used a screenplay
            maker that was provided by Studio binder and helped me format my script either by using keybinds or
            Studio binder automatically doing it for me. The screenplay had everything that would normally be in 
            a script with locations in a shot and what would be happening in the scene as well as who would be 
            speaking in the moment. I also made a storyboard for the assignment where I had added in the locations
            for the shots that would happen in the script. Another part to the script assignment was for me to make a 
            shotlist that explained in depth what would happen during specific shots in the script.

    <h2>Personal Graphic</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            For this assignment I had to make a graphic that I would use personally after the assignment. I had to 
            use Adobe Illustrator for the creation of the graphic by having quite a few versions of the graphic to consider
            from before choosing a final version of the graphic. After having my final version of the graphic I would go through
            a few different versions of the final one and have different colours for the final graphic to be used whenever I publically
            use it. I also needed to have a reflection that talks about what had went well and what could have been done differently.
