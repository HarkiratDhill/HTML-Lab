            When I was starting out using html in <strong>Web Communications</strong> I was initally a bit confused 
            as to what I wassupposed to do, but after reviewing the async learning and using Visual Studio Code more, 
            I was able to understand how to add unordered and order lists. I have also learned how to use the shortcuts on 
            Visual Studio Code when I am making a paragraph or adding in a link or image to my website. Also I have learned a 
            great deal when it comes to using Github and Github desktop from using the Markdown synthax to easily make titles 
            and have links to my email and how to commit and publish my work from Github desktop to the Github website, in order
            for my work to be saved fully.

            My most important skill that I learned from <strong>Digital Media Foundations</strong> was how to operate a 
            camera. From managing the aperture of the camera to focus on the right part of an image. I also learned that
            overexposer of the aperture will cause the shot the camera takes to be too bright for visablity. Another form this 
            can take is having to low of an exposure causing the shot a camera takes to be darker than intended. I also learned 
            how to make scripts properly with the resources given to me in <strong>Digital Media Foundations</strong> with 
            studio binder and how to properly format storyboards and make shotlists.
