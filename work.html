    <h1>Projects Done</h1>
    <p>I have done various types of projects in my time at SAIT, from knowing how to make a
        professional email, to making a script and my personal graphic.

    <h2>Professional Email</h2>

        <p>
            One of my first projects that I had done was a professional email to one of my 
            instrcutors in order to understand how best to articulate any questions I may have with 
            my assignments or asking other members at SAIT for information on how to acess certain tools
            at SAIt. The assignment also showed me the various ways I can send a email to someone and 
            properly address them.
